      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;enabling-simultaneous-ap-and-managed-mode-wifi-on-raspberry-pi-zero-w-raspbian-stretch&#34;&gt;Enabling Simultaneous AP and Managed Mode WiFi on Raspberry Pi Zero W (Raspbian Stretch)&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a pair of Raspberry Pi Zero W boards, and plan to use them for some home automation / IoT-type work. One of my requirements is that the WiFi on this board be able to run as both a &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo; device (also known as &amp;ldquo;client&amp;rdquo; mode) and as an access point, preferrably at the same time. After looking around a bit online, I found several people who claimed to have gotten this working, as well as posts saying it should work, based on the chipset. Despite my best efforts, I was unable to get any of those tutorials to work reliably on their own. By combining some information garnered from each one, along with some trial and error, I was finally able to get AP/Manged mode working, as described below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
