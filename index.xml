      <description>Enabling Simultaneous AP and Managed Mode WiFi on Raspberry Pi Zero W (Raspbian Stretch) I recently purchased a pair of Raspberry Pi Zero W boards, and plan to use them for some home automation / IoT-type work. One of the requirements for my plans is that the WiFi on this board be able to run as both a &amp;ldquo;managed&amp;rdquo; device (also known as &amp;ldquo;client&amp;rdquo; mode) and as an access point, preferrably at the same time.</description>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s with TheWalrus? This one&amp;rsquo;s easy. I was looking for interesting words that end with &amp;lsquo;us&amp;rsquo; that could be purchased as cheap domain names. I picked up a few and so far have only maintained TheWalrus and TheCactus. I have no personal attachment to either one yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can retroactively drum something up if I can dedicate some time to this blog.
What&amp;rsquo;s with this blog? Ever since &amp;ndash; ohh&amp;hellip; &amp;ndash; high school, I&amp;rsquo;ve been meaning to keep an online journal of sorts, before the word &amp;lsquo;Blog&amp;rsquo; was a thing.</description>
